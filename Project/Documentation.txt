* Space between R and [<number>] is allowed, only the space between the instruction and operand is non-trivial, it must exist.

* VisUAL crashes if register list contains a range from a higher number register to a lower number register. My emulation just takes it as a list of 0 registers.

*VisUAL seems to emulate the restricted subset of functionality called Thumb State, my program emulates the unrestricted ARM State. (http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0040d/CACCIDAH.html)

*VisUAL does not accept empty register lists. Neither does my program.

* Went with same memory map as VisUAL.

*VisUAL dynamically allocates memory space for instructions, I do not.
